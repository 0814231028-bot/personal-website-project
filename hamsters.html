    <p class="special">Russian dwarf hamsters can live in pairs of the same gender. 
       However, sometimes the hamsters won't get along and thus must be seperated.
       These hamsters are known to be big hoarders. 
       They will often have their own "secret" stashes within their enclosures.

    <p class="special">
        Russian dwarf hamsters are also known as winter white russian dwarf hamsters.
        They're called winter white because in the winter their coat turns white.

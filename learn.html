    <h2>Five Nights at Freddys</h2>
    <p><h3>
        William and Henry decide to co-own a family restaurant joint, Fredbears Diner.
         William becomes bored of the restaurant and starts experimenting with remnant. 
        Remnant will bring him back to life and or keep him from dying. 
        This eventuallly led William to killing five kids. These kids would later embody the animatronics.
        Of course one of these murders would occur early on.
        The murder of his co-founders daughter, Charlotte Emily. 
        William only killed Charlotte because he had lost his younger son to the restaurant, the crying child.
        The way he lost his son was due to the bite of '83. His older brother, Micheal, was the reason for his death. 
        Micheal thought it would be funny to prank his younger brother since he knew the crying child was horrified by the animatronics.
        However, the animatronic malfunctioned and bit down on the crying child's head. Crushing his frontal lobe.
        William killed Charlotte shortly after this incident. Henry left the company and William was left to create a new one.
        He decided to create, Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Here, he would kill four kids. Those kids would later posses the animatronics of that restaurant.

     <h2>Five Nights at Freddys 2</h2>
     <p><h3>
        Towards the end of the first game, William is chased by the ghosts of the four dead kids. 
        He runs and hides in his old diners suit, Spring Bonnie, inside he is springlocked, and presumed dead.
        His body isn't found and hes left to rot away in the back room. Or is he?
        Due to the murders the new owners of Freddy Fazbears have rebranded and implemented security within the animatronics.
        This allow them to detect threats, AKA anyone wearing a nightguard suit. This puts a target on the nightguard.
        The animatronics are more violent and the older animatronics still haven't been put to rest.
        Thus, the new and older animatronics are hostile towards the nightguard.
        Charlotte Emily posesses the puppet, only attacking if the music box stops playing.
        Mangle and Withered Foxy were the most violent. As Foxy cannot be tricked by the Freddy mask.
        Mangle crawls on the ceilings and is hard to find. They drop down unexpectedly sometimes.
        As it is the only thing that keeps her calm. The nightguard dies in the incident known as the bite of '87.
        Mangle had dropped down from the ceiling and bite down on his head, more specifically, his frontal lobe. 
        The restaurant is shut down after this gruesome incident.

     <h2>Five Nights at Freddys 3</h2>
     <p><h3>
        A horror attarction is created to tell the stories of the murders.
        Here is where Springtrap resides. Spring trap now represents Willian and Spring Bonnie as one.
        As William has now fused with the suit after so many years. The attraction has built 'phantom' animatronics.
        These animatronics are harder to spot due to their coloring that matches the backgrounds of the attarctions.
        Foxys jumpscare reduces sanity and vision. Making the attraction that much more dangerous.
        Enter, Micheal Afton. He is the nightguard for the attraction. Springtrap crawls through the vents to get to the room.
        However, as he soon as he jumpscares the nightguard he faintly realizes that the nightguard is his son.
        Micheal flees from his position, now in search for a new job where he would flee to Sisters Location.

     <h2>Five Nights at Freddys 4</h2>
     <p><h3>
        This game takes place in what is presumably the Afton household. Where the perspective is from the Crying Child.
        Supposedly the fourth game takes place within the child's mind while he is in a coma.
        One that he would never wake up from. Forever tormented by his nightmares until his soul would search for a vessel.
        His soul would posess Golden Freddy, a later recreation of Fredbear, that never lived to se ethe stage.
        He would share this animatronic with another spirit, Cassidy. Also known as the vengful spirit.
        As we don't know when her murder occured and no one knows what happened to her. 
        For this, she cannot rest until William is permanetly dead. 
        Within the fourth game the crying child flashes lights in the nightmare animatronics directions.
        The nightmare animatronics are more horrifying versions of the main four.
        However, Fredbear and Dark Nightmare Fredbear are present. Haunted by two of the one animatronic 
        that lead to his misfortune. Foxy is also a key nightmare. As Micheal always wore a foxy mask.
        Foxy reminds him of his brother as Crying Child would be scared by Micheal wearing the mask.
        Here in his own head, C.C is tormented until his soul is transferred to Golden Freddy.
